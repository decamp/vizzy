### Vizzy Library:
Probably nothing you want.

Simple, fast-config OpenGL visualization engine. Also a staging area for code not ready to percolate up to draw3d or glui.

### Build:
$ ant


### Runtime:
After build, add all jars in **lib** and **target** directories to your project.


### Dependencies:
All are in lib directory.
